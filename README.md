# EmotionNet-Real-Time-Emotion-Detection

The data consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces. The faces have been automatically registered so that the face is more or less centred and occupies about the same amount of space in each image.

The task is to categorize each face based on the emotion shown in the facial expression into one of seven categories (0=Angry, 1=Disgust, 2=Fear, 3=Happy, 4=Sad, 5=Surprise, 6=Neutral)

Project Summary:
Developed a deep learning-based Emotion Detection system that leverages transfer learning techniques using VGGNet and ResNet50 to classify human emotions from facial expressions. The model was trained on a dataset of facial images, enhancing accuracy through data augmentation and fine-tuning of pre-trained models.
